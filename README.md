### Assumptions

- The primary focus of this assignment was to demonstrate the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach and how the code evolves through writing tests and implementing the functionality incrementally.
- As per the guidelines, I have avoided using any mocking libraries, such as Mockito, for this assignment. This decision was made to keep the focus strictly on TDD practices.
- The intention was to showcase the TDD process without introducing additional complexities such as mocking.
